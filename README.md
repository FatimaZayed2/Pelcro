Notes & Guidelines
- After downloading a fresh laravel application, please register a new user, as this user will
be the admin of the system.
- We need a basic data validation, implementation and high level functionality that proves
your knowledge & problem solving skills.
- The email server can be mailtrap.io or any dummy Email server you prefer.
- You don’t need to implement any complex docker containers or anything custom, Laravel
default docker containers like (https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/sail) is okay.
- Create a public repo on your preferred version control provider and share the repo with
us when you are done.
- Diagramming your ideas is nice to have
